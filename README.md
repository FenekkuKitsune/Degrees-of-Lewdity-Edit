# Degrees-of-Lewdity-Edit
Degrees of Lewdity edit script (WIP)

This is a usettings.js file that adds a menu to easily edit stats and settings in the game Degrees of Lewdity. I made this script as I wanted to have fun in the game without completely ruining the chance of getting Feats, as the in-game cheats remove Feat gain.

Currently the file is bare-bones, but I will be working to add basic stat functions, such as changing stress/fatigue/trauma, as well as editing transformation build-up and social stats.
