# Degrees-of-Lewdity-Edit
Degrees of Lewdity edit script (WIP)

This is a usettings.js file that adds a menu to easily edit stats and settings in the game Degrees of Lewdity. I made this script as I wanted to have fun in the game without completely ruining the chance of getting Feats, as the in-game cheats remove Feat gain.

Currently the file is bare-bones, but I will be working to add basic stat functions, such as changing stress/fatigue/trauma, as well as editing transformation build-up and social stats.

## How to Use:
Degrees of Lewdity provides inbuilt functionality for custom javascript via a user settings file, "usettings.js". As a result, using this file is as simple as downloading it and placing it in your Degrees of Lewdity game folder, alongside the HTML file. The game will automatically pick it up and load it in. The menu will be located alongside the other game buttons, underneath Saves and Options.

If you already have a usettings.js file, you can simply copy/paste the code into your own file.

I've made effort to put every relevant variable into an object, so unless you use DoLEdit as a variable name, there shouldn't be any conflicts. There are some temporary variables used, but if necessary they can fairly easily be changed.
